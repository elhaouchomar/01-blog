# Task: Polish Left Sidebar and Enforce Pure CSS

The goal is to finalize the functionality and styling of the `LeftSidebarComponent`. We have partially connected the component to Angular's router and data, but there are inline styles to clean up and we must ensure the "Pure CSS" requirement is met (Vanilla CSS, no inline styles, premium design).

## Status
- [x] Move inline styles from `left-sidebar.html` to `left-sidebar.css`
- [x] Add `.filled` class for Material Symbols in `left-sidebar.css` (or global)
- [x] Verify functionality of `routerLinkActive` styling
- [x] Ensure guest user view is properly styled via CSS classes
- [x] Review and refine design details (spacing, shadows, colors) to match "Premium" aesthetic using CSS variables.

## User Review Required
> Please confirm if "purecss" implies strict Vanilla CSS (no inline styles, no frameworks) or if you are referring to the specific CSS library 'Pure.css'. I am proceeding with the assumption of **Vanilla CSS** following the project's design system.
